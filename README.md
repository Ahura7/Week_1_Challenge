## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Given the domain Airwallex operates in, a vertically integrated solution could be the way to go for the company. This includes acquiring or developing their own marketplace solution and accounting solutions for their clients. Being a unicorn startup company Airwallex is at the forefront of technological developments already, however, it is yet to use blockchain technology for its product offerings and this could be another technological development for the company.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The offerings above would remove additional costs of integrating with third party solutions and provide the company control over the full end to end product experience. Additionally, through leveraging blockchain, the company could further enhance its security and more easily track payments.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Since Airwallex has an extensive API offering, integrating into additional online payment solutions and marketplaces should be an easier undertaking. These additional techonologies could utilise machine learning algorimths to determine payment behaviours and help the company decide the next currency to unlock for its customers.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
